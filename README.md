This is the Read Me file for Weather-App.
I created my own API based on the data gathered from the three external APIs listed below.


Technologies:

Node.js: express, ejs

I used three different external APIs:
https://www.weatherapi.com/docs/
https://openweathermap.org/api
https://open-meteo.com/en/docs#api-documentation

D3 (Data visualization)
The two graphs I used for the Lab include the bar graph https://observablehq.com/@d3/bar-chart
and the line graph https://d3-graph-gallery.com/graph/density_basic.html

The backend was created in MongoDB.

I used a color picker to select colors from my background photo to use for my color scheme.
